# Feeding Assistant Robot
This repository contains all related documents and files about Feeding Assistant Robot project. This project is being held for the Senior Design Project course at Mechatronics Engineering Department at Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. Also, this project is advised by Prof. Erhan Akdogan at Biomechatronics Laboratory.

Currently, our team consists of four senior Mechatronics Engineering students: [Mustafa UGUR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-uğur-41b13310a), [Oguzhan YARDIMCI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oguzhan-yardimci-505118144), [Cemil YILMAZ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cemil-yılmaz-664a7b13b) and [Haluk BASI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haluk-başı-9a2321143).

To see the files related with the simulation of the robot arm go to the file [simulationOfTheRobotArm](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/tree/master/simulationOfTheRobotArm).

To run simulation files for the trajectory planning go to  the directory [simulationOfTheRobotArm/filesForSimulation/urdf/matlabFiles/](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/tree/master/simulationOfTheRobotArm/filesForSimulation/urdf/matlabFiles)

To run simulation files for the dynamic analyses of the robot arm go to  the directory [simulationOfTheRobotArm/filesForController](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/tree/master/simulationOfTheRobotArm/filesForSimulation/urdf/matlabFiles)

To see the files realated with the mout tacking algorithm go to the file [mouthTrackingAlgorithm](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/tree/master/mouthTrackingAlgorithm)

To see the whole CAD files go to the [CADFiles](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/tree/master/CADFiles) and to see the assembly file open the file [MATLAB_feeding_robot_arm.SLDASM](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/blob/master/CADFiles/MATLAB_feeding_robot_arm.SLDASM)

And, to see our team final report for the fall term look the [finalReport.pdf](https://github.com/Ugurmustafa97/FeedingAssistantRobot/blob/master/finalReport.pdf)
